# ISC 2024 Tutorial - HPC Towards the Compute Continuum

## Date
 12 May 2024, 2 pm – 6 pm

## Overview
The compute continuum is an emerging concept for distributed (and typically centralised) e-infrastructures comprising a whole set of resources from the edge up to the cloud and HPC. Such infrastructures are needed for various high-impact applications. Examples are improving weather forecast simulations, which run on HPC systems, by collecting observables from IoT devices. To make cities smart, edge-controlled services are being coupled to compute-intensive machine-learning processes. A key enabling technology is container orchestration, which facilitates deployment of software components and services both on edge devices as well as cloud infrastructures. The goals of this tutorial are to create a basic understanding of the compute continuum, to improve the knowledge of relevant technologies, and to train their use by deploying and adapting workflows in a compute continuum. The participants will learn about technologies such as containers, the container orchestration solution Kubernetes, an extension towards the edge called KubeEdge, and Prometheus, a software solution for service monitoring. Based on this knowledge, hands-on experience can be acquired by implementing a workflow deployed as containers on remote server and local edge nodes.
